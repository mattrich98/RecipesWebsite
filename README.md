<h3>A basic recipe website project.</h3>

<br>
<p>Overall, I'm happy with how the website turned out, although the CSS could have been cleaned up more.</p>
<p>I stuck to the blue theme and included some recipes that I thought I might want to try. I would like to add more, but also I would like to continue 'The Odin Project' and work on other projects as well.</p>
<p>I googled information that I didn't know yet, such as "display: inline-block;" I wanted to make 'index.html' more organized.</p>
<p>I would also like to try CSS webkits and animations in the future.</p>
