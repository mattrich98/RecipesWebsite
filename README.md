# recipes-website
A basic recipe website project. 
https://mattrich98.github.io/recipes-website/ (Link to website)
(Completed) 

Overall I am happy with how the website turned out although CSS could be tidier. I stuck with a blue theme and put recipes that I might like to try too. I would add more but I want to continue The Odin Project and work on other projects too.  

I googled some information that I didn't know like yet such as, "display: inline-block;". I wanted to organise the index.html better.

Also sometime in the future I would like to try experimenting with CSS webkits and animations.
